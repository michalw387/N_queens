# N Queens Puzzle Solver 

## Project Description

This project addresses the Eight Queens Puzzle in 2D and 3D spaces. The puzzle involves placing eight queens on a chessboard so no two can attack each other. The solutions are graphically displayed. A simulated annealing algorithm is also implemented to find a solution in 2D, which is also visually represented.
